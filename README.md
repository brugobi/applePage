# applePage - Clone
Its a clone of old an old version of the Apple website webpage


- In this project, our assignment consists of making a clone of a old version of Apple page (https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/). As usual, we ignored any ads, comments or interactive elements so donâ€™t worry about what happens when you change the page width. The Focus is on making it look similar.
